# Enhanced Matrix Column Set Analysis System - Local Build

## Features
- **Real-time Data Change Tracking**: Every matrix cell change is tracked and logged
- **Dynamic Statistics Updates**: All statistics recalculate automatically when data changes
- **Live Correlation Analysis**: Correlation matrix updates in real-time with color-coded heatmap
- **Future Value Projections**: FV calculations adjust automatically based on matrix data variance
- **Change History**: Complete log of all data modifications with timestamps
- **Time-based Analysis**: Continuous monitoring with correlation threshold detection
- **Export Functionality**: Save all results and change history to JSON

## How to Use

### 1. Setup
- Download all files to a folder
- Open `enhanced-index.html` in your web browser
- No server required - runs completely locally

### 2. Matrix Operations
- **Generate Matrix**: Creates random data matrix with specified dimensions
- **Load Sample**: Loads predefined sample data for testing
- **Edit Cells**: Click any matrix cell to modify values - all stats update instantly

### 3. Real-time Features
- **Change Tracking**: Every cell edit is logged with timestamp and old/new values
- **Statistics**: Mean, variance, std deviation update automatically
- **Correlation**: Matrix correlations recalculate on every change
- **Future Value**: Adjusts based on data variance (risk adjustment)

### 4. Time Analysis
- **Start Analysis**: Begins continuous monitoring
- **Correlation Threshold**: Set minimum correlation level to trigger alerts
- **Real-time Updates**: All calculations refresh every 5 seconds during analysis

### 5. Export Data
- Click "Export Results" to save all data, statistics, and change history as JSON

## Key Improvements in This Local Build
1. **Proper Event Handling**: All matrix inputs have onchange, oninput, and onkeyup handlers
2. **Real-time Calculations**: Statistics recalculate immediately on any data change
3. **Change Logging**: Complete history of all modifications
4. **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded correlation matrix and status indicators
5. **Risk-Adjusted FV**: Future value calculations include variance-based risk adjustment
6. **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
